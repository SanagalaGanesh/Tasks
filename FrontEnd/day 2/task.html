      <b>Konidela Pawan Kalyan</b> (born Konidela Sri Kalyan Kumar; 2 September
      1971 ) is an Indian politician, actor, serving as the
      <mark>11th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024</mark>.
      He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural
      Water Supply; Environment, Forest, Science and Technology in the
      Government of Andhra Pradesh as MLA representing the Pithapuram
      constituency. He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.
      <br /><br />As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and
      mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu
      states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a
      "cult following." He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and
      has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times
      since 2012. He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award
      among other accolades. <br /><br />Kalyan made his acting debut in the
      1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six
      consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri
      (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films
      established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from
      his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase. In 2001, he became the first ever
      South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi. Kalyan later faced a slump, yet
      his popularity kept soaring despite the flops. He made a comeback with
      Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued
      with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala
      Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received
      the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Both Kushi and
      Attarintiki Daredi held the record for the highest-grossing Telugu film of
      its era. <br /><br />
      Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate. In 1997, he was awarded the title
      "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts
      demonstration. He practices various martial arts, which he regularly
      showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He
      is known as "Power Star" among his fans and the media. Kalyan is also
      recognized for his extensive philanthropic work, supporting various social
      causes. He has offered financial assistance to both individuals and
      organizations in need. In 2007, he established the charity Common Man
      Protection Force. <br /><br />

      In March 2014, Pawan Kalyan founded the Janasena Party (JSP). Although he
      chose not to contest the 2014 elections, his support and campaigns were
      pivotal in securing victory for the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh. He
      later brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in
      Uddanam, and led protests against forced land acquisition, and illegal
      mining in reserved forests. In 2019, JSP contested its first elections,
      winning one MLA seat with around 6% of the vote. Following this, Kalyan
      and JSP focused on issues like farmer welfare, illegal sand mining,
      women's safety, and land encroachment. In 2023, he launched a state-wide
      tour in his customized vehicle 'Varahi' to connect with voters. In the
      2024 elections, Kalyan played a key role in forming an alliance between
      JSP, TDP, and BJP, which led to a landslide victory. Janasena won each of
      the 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats it contested. Kalyan was elected from the
      Pithapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes, subsequently
      becoming the deputy chief minister.

    <h4>Early life</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Pawan Kalyan was born as Konidela Kalyan Kumar on 2 September 1971 in a
      Telugu family to Konidela Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Bapatla, Andhra
      Pradesh. Venkata Rao worked as an excise police constable and was
      transferred on a regular basis. <br /><br />
      Kalyan was educated at the St. Joseph's High School in Nellore and later
      in Madras (now Chennai). In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the
      Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.
      He also holds a black belt in Karate.

    <h4>Acting Career</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>1996-1997: Early work </b><br /><br />
      Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi
      directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana. It was produced by Allu Aravind under
      Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of
      Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign
      prior to its release. Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released
      with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the film's release,
      posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience
      interest. Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the
      box-office. Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received
      significant attention. <br /><br />
      His second film Gokulamlo Seeta (1997), a drama film released the
      following year. It was directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and starred Kalyan
      alongside Raasi and Harish. In the film, Kalyan plays a spoiled rich youth
      who transforms his reckless ways and fights against societal and familial
      opposition to win his love. Gokulamlo Seeta was the first film where
      Kalyan was credited as 'Pawan Kalyan' after he was awarded the title
      "Pawan" in March 1997. It was a commercial success. <br /><br />
      Kalyan's third film was Suswagatham (1998) directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa
      Rao and produced by R. B. Choudary under the Super Good Films banner. It
      starred Kalyan and Devayani (in her Telugu debut), with music composed by
      S. A. Rajkumar. Kalyan was first credited with the title Power Star in
      this film. In the film, Kalyan played a young man who loses everything due
      to his blind love for a girl. His performance in the film was critically
      acclaimed. Suswagatham sowed the seeds for Kalyan's rise to stardom. The
      film became a super hit at the box office. <br /><br />

      <center>

      </center>
      Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and
      co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan
      Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he
      was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script
      with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had
      worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta. The film was a major hit, launching
      Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.
      <br /><br />
      It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state
      Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of
      India. The film was remade in Kannada as
      <i>Preethsu Thappenilla</i> (2000) and in Hindi as
      <i>Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai</i>Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001). <br /><br />
      In November 1998, there were reports of Kalyan collaborating with
      Malayalam director Fazil for a project to be produced by G. V. G. Raju,
      who had earlier produced Tholi Prema. However, his next film turned out to
      be Thammudu, where he played the role of a kickboxer. Released in July
      1999, Thammudu was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad. The film
      collected a distributor share of ₹9.25–9.46 crore, emerging as a
      blockbuster and generating a profit of over ₹4 crores for buyers. It
      became the second-highest-grossing film in the Nizam region after
      Choodalani Vundi (1998). Kalyan's performance as a youth competing in a
      kickboxing contest was widely acclaimed. The film's success led to it
      being remade in Tamil as Badri (2001), in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and
      in Bengali as Champion (2003). <br /><br />Next, Kalyan acted in Puri
      Jagannadh's first directorial venture, Badri (2000). It starred debutants
      Ameesha Patel and Renu Desai (whom he would later marry). It was produced
      by T. Trivikrama Rao and the music was composed by Ramana Gogula. The film
      became a blockbuster at the box office. Badri played a crucial role in
      expanding Pawan Kalyan's appeal from class audiences, who admired his
      earlier hits to a broader mass audience. The intense scenes between Pawan
      Kalyan and Prakash Raj remain a significant highlight in Pawan's career.
      The film's dialogues and songs were huge hits with the youth. The line
      "Nuvvu Nanda aithe nenu Badri Badrinath" and songs like "Ye Chikitha" and
      "Bangala Kathamlo" continued to be popular even after two decades. Badri
      was later remade in Hindi as Shart: The Challenge (2004). <br /><br />

      </center>
      Kalyan's next film was Kushi (2001) co-starring Bhumika. It was directed
      by S. J. Surya and produced by A. M. Rathnam. Mani Sharma provided the
      score and soundtrack. Kalyan also choreographed all the action sequences
      in the film. Initially begun in 1999 as a bilingual along with its Tamil
      version, also titled Kushi (2000), the Telugu version was delayed due to
      Kalyan's prior commitment to Badri. It was a blockbuster at the box office
      and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film ever at the time.
      The film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, music,
      cinematography and especially the performance of Pawan Kalyan. Kushi was
      the culmination of a streak of six consecutive hits for Pawan Kalyan and
      his style, mannerisms and dialogues from the film were much imitated by
      the youth. <br /><br />
      The four consecutive blockbuster hits—Tholi Prema, Thammudu, Badri, and
      Kushi—had a cult status among youth at the turn of the millennium. Pawan
      Kalyan became a youth icon, setting trends in action sequences, style, and
      fashion. These films gave him a massive fanbase, distinct from his elder
      brother Chiranjeevi's. In 2001, Kalyan became the first South Indian brand
      ambassador for Pepsi, while Chiranjeevi promoted Coca-Cola. <br /><br />
      <br />
      <b>2002-2007:Directorial debut and career fluctuations</b>
      <br /><br />Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote,
      directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai. Produced by Allu Aravind
      with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a
      coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment. Johnny had the
      highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at
      the time and was released with over 250 prints worldwide. Kalyan's
      clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed
      many fans. Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive
      hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action
      choreography. Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny
      T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular. It was also
      screened at the International Film Festival of India. <br /><br />
      In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by
      Veera Shankar and produced by Kalyan's older brother Nagendra Babu under
      Anjana Productions banner. Kalyan played the title role, wrote the
      screenplay and choreographed three songs. The action scenes were also
      conceived and choreographed by him. The film, starring Kalyan and Meera
      Jasmine, received mixed reviews and was an average performer at the box
      office. Kalyan's choreography of the realistic action scenes was praised.
      His unique style, including wearing double pants, grabbed attention at the
      time. <br /><br />
      His next film Balu (2005) was A. Karunakaran's second directorial starring
      Kalyan, after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Aswini Dutt under
      Vyjayanthi Movies banner. It co-starred Shriya, Neha Oberoi and Gulshan
      Grover. Balu was extensively filmed in Delhi and Agra, with a special set
      constructed near the Taj Mahal and another in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad,
      at a cost of ₹90 lakh. Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's
      flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh. These
      pants later became a trend among the youth. Balu was the first Telugu film
      to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box
      office. <br /><br />
      In May 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil filmmaker Dharani was released.
      It starred Kalyan in the title role and Meera Chopra, Sanusha, Ashutosh
      Rana, and Mukesh Rishi in supporting roles. Produced by A. M. Rathnam, who
      had earlier produced Kushi (2001), the story follows Bangaram, a reporter
      who dreams of working for the BBC. Notably, it was the first time in
      Kalyan's career that he did not have a female lead opposite him. The film
      received mixed to negative reviews, and Kalyan reportedly gave refunds to
      the film's distributors due to its underperformance. <br /><br />In March
      2006, Pawan Kalyan’s second directorial venture, Satyagrahi (tagline:
      Satyame Naa Ayudham; transl. Truth is my weapon), featuring him in the
      role of a role of student union leader, was launched with a high-profile
      event at Annapurna Studios. At the event, Kalyan expressed frustration
      with societal problems and aimed to use Satyagrahi to highlight these
      issues in a commercially appealing format. Producer A. M. Rathnam
      announced that the film would be made in Telugu and Hindi, with a Bengali
      dub. Despite initial enthusiasm and notable collaborators like P. C.
      Sreeram and A. R. Rahman, the project was shelved. In October 2021, Kalyan
      revealed that the film, inspired by Jayaprakash Narayan's Emergency
      movement, was set aside to focus on real-life activism, finding it more
      fulfilling to address social issues directly rather than through cinema.
      <br /><br />
      Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa
      Rao, with Asin, and Sandhya were cast alongside him. The film was produced
      under the Super Good Films banner and marked Kalyan's first role set in a
      rural background. Pawan Kalyan plays the title role of Annavaram, a
      blacksmith who, driven by his love for his sister, becomes a vigilante in
      Hyderabad to dismantle the city's criminal underworld. Released in
      December 2006, the film was an above-average grosser. <br /><br />

        <img src="6.jpg" alt="OG" style="height: 300px" />
      </center>
      Kalyan's next film was Jalsa (2008), written and directed by Trivikram
      Srinivas. Jalsa marks the first collaboration between Pawan Kalyan and
      Trivikram, a partnership that later extended to multiple projects in the
      future. Mahesh Babu provided the voiceover for the film. In the film,
      Pawan Kalyan plays Sanjay Sahu, an aerobics instructor with a troubled
      past as a Naxalite. Kalyan's performance, especially his comic timing and
      signature dialogues, played a significant role in the film's success.
      Jalsa set multiple box office records on its opening day, including the
      highest first-day collection for a Telugu film and the highest for any
      South Indian film in a single state. It became the highest-grossing Telugu
      film of 2008 and was praised for its lead performances, music, humour, and
      witty dialogues. This marked Kalyan's first success after five consecutive
      underperforming films. <br /><br />Pawan Kalyan's next film, Puli (2010),
      an action thriller, was written and directed by S. J. Surya and produced
      by Singanamala Ramesh Babu with a budget of ₹40 crore. Initially titled
      Komaram Puli, the film was renamed Puli on its second day of release due
      to objections from Komaram Sony Rao, the grandson of tribal legend Komaram
      Bheem, whose name had inspired the original title. The Nizam distribution
      rights were sold to Geetha Arts for ₹12 crore, a record-breaking sum at
      the time. Upon release, Puli was critically panned and ultimately became a
      box office disaster. <br /><br />In August 2010, an official announcement
      was made that Kalyan was going to play a role in a movie about Jesus
      Christ to be directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao. With a production cost
      of $30 million, it was touted as the most expensive film to be ever made
      in Indian cinema. The film was set to be shot in Israel and the
      Palestinian Territories with an all-Indian cast, primarily featuring
      children. It was reported that the producers spent time touring sites in
      Jerusalem and around the Sea of Galilee and have approached the
      Palestinian Authority about filming in Jericho and Bethlehem. Shooting for
      the film was said to begin in Jerusalem in October 2010 and the film was
      to be released in 2011. The film was said to include seven devotional
      songs. It was to be a 195-minute film, with versions in four languages,
      including English. <br /><br />In 2011, Pawan Kalyan starred in Teen Maar,
      directed by Jayanth C. Paranjee with a screenplay by Trivikram Srinivas.
      It is a remake of the Hindi film Love Aaj Kal (2009). Kalyan plays dual
      roles: Michael Velayudham, a carefree chef in Italy navigating modern
      relationships, and Arjun Palwai, whose traditional 1980s love story
      profoundly influences Michael's journey toward understanding the true
      value of love and commitment. The film was an average grosser at the box
      office. <br /><br />Kalyan's next film was Vishnuvardhan's gangster drama
      Panjaa (2011). Apart from Kalyan, it starred Sarah-Jane Dias, Anjali
      Lavania, and Jackie Shroff. Kalyan showcased a new look for Panjaa,
      combining a well-trimmed beard with his moustache. In the film, Kalyan
      plays Jai, a loyal hitman for a powerful gangster, who is forced to go on
      the run after a mission goes wrong. Released in December 2011, Panjaa
      received mixed reviews from critics. It had a moderate reception from
      overseas audiences but struggled to make an impact at the domestic box
      office. Over time, it has been regarded as an underrated film in Telugu
      cinema. <br /><br />

      Hyderabad on 20 November 2013 In 2012, Pawan Kalyan starred in Gabbar
      Singh, directed by Harish Shankar. This film, a remake of the Hindi hit
      Dabangg (2010), made notable changes to the original screenplay and
      characters. Kalyan played Venkataratnam Naidu, a police officer who takes
      on the alias Gabbar Singh to combat a local thug's corrupt political
      schemes. Gabbar Singh set new records for opening day, first weekend, and
      first week collections in Tollywood, grossing around ₹110 crore worldwide.
      It became the second-highest-grossing Telugu film at the time surpassing
      Dookudu (2011), and emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film of the
      year. Kalyan's performance was acclaimed for its charisma and energy,
      blending mass appeal with comedy, earning him the Filmfare Award for Best
      Actor – Telugu, the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, a CineMAA Award,
      among other accolades.
      <br /><br />Later in 2012, Kalyan appeared in Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu,
      a political action film directed by Puri Jagannadh, marking their second
      collaboration after 12 years. Kalyan played Rambabu, a
      mechanic-turned-journalist who battles a corrupt politician. The film
      faced political controversy and protests, leading to halted screenings in
      Telangana and calls for a ban. In response, the producers made cuts and
      modifications. Despite this, it was successful, earning ₹52 crore in its
      opening weekend against a ₹25 crore budget. <br /><br />

      In March 2014, Kalyan founded the Janasena Party and actively campaigned
      in the 2014 elections. Thereafter, he continued his political career
      alongside his film career. His first film release after starting Janasena
      was Gopala Gopala (2015), a Telugu remake of the Hindi film OMG – Oh My
      God! (2012). The film featured Kalyan starring alongside Venkatesh and was
      directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani. It was produced by D. Suresh Babu and
      Sharrath Marar. Made on a budget of ₹12 crore, the film was released in

      God. It received positive reviews from critics and was commercially
      successful grossing ₹88.1 crore with a distributor share of ₹41.1 crore.

      Trivikram Srinivas, was touted as his 25th film. The film stars Kalyan,
      Aadhi Pinisetty, Keerthy Suresh and Anu Emmanuel in lead roles. In the
      film, Kalyan plays Abhishikth Bhargav, the eldest son of a powerful
      businessman who returns to his family’s company from exile to uncover the
      truth behind his father's death and reclaim his rightful place in the
      business empire. Upon release, it received negative reviews from both
      critics and audiences, alike. The film was a box-office bomb. <br /><br />
      In August 2017, Pawan Kalyan announced his intention to focus on politics
      starting October 2017 after completing his film commitments. Following the
      release of Agnyathavaasi in January 2018, Kalyan officially retired from
      the film industry to concentrate on his political career with the Janasena
      Party. During this period, from late 2017 to late 2019, he did not take on
      any new film projects. Speculation about his return to cinema began in
      September 2019, with discussions about potential scripts from directors
      like Krish and efforts by producer Dil Raju to convince him to choose a
      project. <br /><br />

      In November 2019, it was announced that Kalyan would star in the Telugu
      remake of the Hindi film Pink (2016), later titled Vakeel Saab. Produced
      by Boney Kapoor and Dil Raju, and directed by Venu Sriram with dialogues
      by Trivikram Srinivas, filming for Vakeel Saab began on 20 January 2020,
      marking Kalyan's return to cinema after a two-year break following
      Agnyaathavaasi. The film, which also features Nivetha Thomas, Anjali,
      Ananya Nagalla, Prakash Raj, and Shruti Haasan, was released in April
      2021, making it Kalyan's first film release in three years. Kalyan plays
      Satyadev, a former lawyer who overcomes personal tragedy and alcoholism to
      fight for justice and support wronged women. Vakeel Saab faced major
      challenges, such as blocked ticket price hikes and cancelled screenings
      due to political tensions and a COVID-19 lockdown during the second wave.
      Despite these issues, the film grossed ₹137.65 crore worldwide, becoming
      the second highest-grossing Telugu film of the year. <br /><br />

      In 2022, Pawan Kalyan starred in Bheemla Nayak, an action thriller film
      directed by Saagar K Chandra and written by Trivikram Srinivas. The film
      stars Pawan Kalyan and Rana Daggubati in lead roles. Kalyan plays Bheemla
      Nayak, a dedicated police officer known for his strong sense of justice
      and connection with his community. The film netted ₹37 crore on opening
      day in India, becoming the best post-pandemic opener in Andhra Pradesh and
      Telangana. Bheemla Nayak grossed over ₹192 crore worldwide in 20 days,
      despite restrictions like lowered ticket prices and a ban on early morning
      shows in Andhra Pradesh, which affected its earnings. <br /><br />Kalyan's
      2023 release was Bro, in which he starred alongside his nephew Sai Dharam
      Tej, under the direction of Samuthirakani. Produced by People Media
      Factory and Zee Studios, it is a remake of the director's own Tamil film
      Vinodhaya Sitham (2021). In the film, Pawan Kalyan plays Titan, a
      mysterious figure who represents Time, guiding Mark through a
      transformative journey to rectify his past and reconcile with his
      responsibilities before his final departure from Earth. The film received
      mixed-to-average reviews from critics. <br /><br />Since the Y. S. Jagan
      Mohan Reddy government came to power in Andhra Pradesh in 2019, Pawan
      Kalyan's films have faced significant political challenges. His films
      Vakeel Saab, Bheemla Nayak, and Bro, have encountered obstacles like
      cancelled benefit shows, blocked ticket price hikes, and restrictions on
      screenings. These issues are widely attributed to Kalyan's outspoken
      criticism of the government, leading to a perceived political vendetta
      that has affected the releases and earnings of his films. Despite these
      challenges, his films have still performed well at the box office

      highest paid Indian actors.
